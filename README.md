# Live Project

## Intro:

For my internship with Prosper IT Consulting, I worked with a small team of fellow interns to develop a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#. The application being developed is a Management Portal site for a construction company, for managers to view and edit employees, jobs, and schedules, as well as serving as a portal for information for employees. This project was a great learning opportunity, working with a team, and jumping into an app in the middle of its development, instead of starting from the ground up. The project was structured in two week sprints, during which I focused on both Front-End and Back-End development stories. Below is a list of all the stories I worked on during my six weeks dedicated to the Management Portal project. Please feel free to ask me any questions about what you see here! I did a lot of work on this project that I'm very proud of, and would be delighted to chat about it at any time.
