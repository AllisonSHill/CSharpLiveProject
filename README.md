# LiveProjectSprint1

At the end of my time at the Tech Academy, I worked on a group project intended to simulate a real-world team development environment. My fellow students and I worked together in two-week sprints to develop a full scale MVC application for a real client. During my first two week sprint, I worked on three stories. 

The first story was the front-end development of a modal on the "Job Creation" page to add shift times to new jobs as they were created. 

After I finished the front end story and created a modal in which to enter shift times, I took on a second story for the initial implementation of the modal's functionality. The goal of this story was to write a function for the ShiftTime Modal to save a ShiftTime object and match it with a job that is being created. There was a note in the story that there would be a follow up story to link the ShiftTime to the correct Job in the database. I accomplished this task by adding to the Create function within the ShiftTime Controller, 

he first part of this implementation will beto collect the information from the form submission and send it to the ShiftTime controller.
